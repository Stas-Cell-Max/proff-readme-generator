    The README Generator App is a command-line tool developed to simplify and expedite the creation of professional README files for software projects. Built with Node.js and utilizing the Inquirer package, this application guides users through a series of prompts to gather essential information, including project details, installation instructions, usage guidelines, licensing, and more. The generated READMEs are structured, consistent, and enhance the documentation process for developers.
